This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using a trained Logistic Regression model.
The model is built on selected diagnostic features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (UCI).

**Features**

-User-friendly web interface

-Input-based prediction of tumor type

-Shows malignant probability

-Visualizations such as accuracy plot & confusion matrix

-Deployed using Streamlit Cloud

**Tech Stack**

-Python

-Streamlit

-Scikit-learn

-Pandas, NumPy

-Matplotlib / Seaborn
